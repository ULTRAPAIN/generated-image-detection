[below models were trained for only 10 epochs]
cnn.h5: inoptimised; low convolutions; reduced input size from original; many dense layers; high accuracy in train, valid and test set, but fails in real world tests. 
cnn_1702836567.371856.h5: high and structured convolutions; one dense layer only in the output; reduced input size from original; Training images fed to it had rotation range of 45; shows zero validation accuracy.
models\cnn_1702919691.332223.h5: highly structured depthwise-pointwise convolutions in latter half of network; one dense neuron in the output layer; full size images; basically no training hapenned to the model, maybe the reason is that there are no dense neurons in the hidden layers.
models\cnn_1703099130.684797.h5: highly structured depthwise-pointwise convolutions in most layers. two dense layers in the end; full size images; was trained on only 10000 images (5000 of each label). Model needs to be trained for more epochs to grasp its full potential.
models\cnn_1703148309.959151.h5: Same as previous model but trained for 100 epochs; Suffers from dying neuron problem, due to soo many ReLU layers; Loss and accuracy flatline because of this.
models\resnet_clf_history_1703494079.424392.h5: Fine tunes the ResNet50 model with 256 dense layers and output layer in the end; All previous layers have  been frozen; finally validation accuracy changes and is increasing, however it is slow; Trained for 100 epochs.
models\resnet_clf_history_1703503738.017127.h5: same as previous model; trained for total 200 epochs; leads to overfitting.
